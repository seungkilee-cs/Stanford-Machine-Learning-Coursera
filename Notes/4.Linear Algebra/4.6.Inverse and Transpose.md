# Inverse and Transpose

Matrix Inverse:
A x A^-1 =A^-1 x A = I 

Matrix Transpose
Row to Column

A is m x n
B = A^T then B is n x m

A_ij = B_ji

A x B is n x n matrix

```octave
% Initialize matrix A 
A = [1,2,0;0,5,6;7,0,9]

% Transpose A 
A_trans = A' 

% Take the inverse of A 
A_inv = inv(A)

% What is A^(-1)*A? 
A_invA = inv(A)*A
```
