# Properties

A x B != B X A (Not Commutative)
A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C (Associative)

Identity Matrix -> n x m Matrix I such that I_ii = 1 for i <= n
A x I = I x A = A

```octave
% Initialize random matrices A and B 
A = [1,2;4,5]
B = [1,1;0,2]

% Initialize a 2 by 2 identity matrix
I = eye(2)

% The above notation is the same as I = [1,0;0,1]

% What happens when we multiply I*A ? 
IA = I*A 

% How about A*I ? 
AI = A*I 

% Compute A*B 
AB = A*B 

% Is it equal to B*A? 
BA = B*A 

% Note that IA = AI but AB != BA
